Bluetooth based communication system for Wireless Charing I developed during my time as a Firmware Engineering Intern at ON Semiconductor

The project was developed on the Nordic nRF5 SDK and runs on a Nordic nRF51 board. There are two seperate components, the communication system for the Power Receiving Unit (wpt_pru) and the Power Transmitting Unit (wpt_ptu).
